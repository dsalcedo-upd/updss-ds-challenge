# Challenge Mechanics

## Groupings
- Challenges will be done per team (3-4 members per team).
- You will have the same team members until the end of the semester.
- Each group will have to provide a team name

## Scoring
- Each challenge will have different difficulties: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. 
- Each difficulty will have different maximum points that can be earned. Beginner challenges - 1000 points, Intermediate challenges - 2000 points, Advanced Challenges - 3000 points.
- 70% of the points will come from the accuracy of the results and 30% will come from the punctuality of the submissions (how fast/early the team submitted). Accuracy refers to the correctness of your answer and how you code. For example, if you were able to produce the required result but were not able to use the required package, or code is not readable and reproducible, partial points will only be awarded.
- Point system for accuracy (70%) is written in the challenge instructions
- Point system for punctuality (30%)

$300 - [6.818*(no. of 30 mins that have passed after release of challenge)]$

Ex. A submission submitted at 9:45 pm will have a score of 293.18182 (assuming that the problem was released at 9:00 pm).
Should a team submit their notebook past the deadline, they will automatically get a score of zero (0) for punctuality.
- At the end of each challenge, we will declare a winner. 
- Points earned will be cumulative and at the end of the semester, we will declare a grand winner.
